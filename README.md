**Two** options how to install application:
- First, install the APK (the zipping file) App on any smartphone with `Android OS 4.1` or higher.
- Second, the app is available in `Google Play` to download, directly to Android Systems: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shopingassistant

After installing, open settings, then open `Accessibility`. After, click on the `TalkBack` (Android’s Software) and `switch it` **“on"**. Now the user can access blind-friendly mode.

### Start the app and the following screen will appear:

<br /><br />

Starting the app opens the main view. The screen has two buttons on the bottom and one bar on the top. 

**The two buttons indicate:** 
 - **Left button** takes a picture of the view. After, it will open **sub-menu with recognition modes**
 
 - **Right button** takes a picture of the view. After, the app starts **voice assistant**, which recognizes user’s intent.

<br /><br />

After choosing the **left button**, the user has two modes to choose from: 

- #### “What is on the shelf?” 
> Detecting products. It detects all products in the photo and reads the appropriate categories.
- #### “What am I holding?” 
> It classifies what product exactly the user holds in their hands. The mode recognizes specific information like the brand and the name of the product. Asisto reads and then shows the name in the top bar on the main menu along with certainty expressed in percentage.
- #### “Ask me” 
> Starts voice assistant. User can ask “What is on the shelf?”, “What am I holding ?” or give other questions but with the same intention.
- #### “Exit” 
> Closes the menu and comes back to the main screen
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

<br /><br />
This pop-up appears after **choosing** `"What is on the shelf?"` mode or after **asking** `with voice assistant with the same intention`. 

- #### “Where is something?”  
> After clicking it, the users are directed to a brail keyboard and can type the name of the product by themselves.

- #### ”Cereal” 
>is one of the 5 item types that Asisto recognizes: coffee, cereal, tomato sauce, dairy, fruits. After clicking the name, Asisto **indicates exactly** where the product(s) are.

*For example, Asisto will indicate: “One item, At Eleven, Top”*

So far, we have collected 100GB of data which consists of **234 000** pictures.   

We were constrained by the amount of the data. We had to collected almost all data **by ourselves** because there is no such data publicly available.  
We also had limited founds on Azure Student account. Big data is a very expensive domain and 100$ is not enough. 

We are certain that the main price of 50 000 on the Azure account **will let us fully develop Asisto**. 
Nevertheless, we are proud to have collected 234 000 retail product pictures. It was achieved thanks to burst mode. `In burst mode, several photographs are captured in quick succession by either pressing the shutter button or holding it down.` 

In a regular middle-sized shop there are about **3000 retail products**. We collected **71** categories of classification and 5 categories of detection. We are aware that collecting data of all those products will be very time-consuming. For this reason, **there are no products like Asisto on the market**. Due to time requirements of the task we **are planning to build a website** where `volunteers will help us to upload and tag pictures` of retail products.  
**We are going to present** our application at the WiMLDS *(Poznan Woman in Machine Learning & Data Science)* where we are going to talk about main features of the app and show an audience how supporting our project will help visually impaired people. **We are hoping to create a dedicated Asisto community because we brign vision where its needed the most.**
